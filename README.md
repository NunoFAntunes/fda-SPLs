FDA Structured Product Label (SPL) Summarization & Extraction
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a GenAI + NLP pipeline for healthcare documents using the FDA Structured Product Labels (SPLs) dataset from DailyMed
.

The pipeline ingests SPL XML files, extracts and normalizes structured data (e.g., drug names, NDCs, manufacturer info, indications, dosage, warnings), and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate patient-friendly summaries at multiple reading levels.

This project is designed to showcase skills relevant to GenAI/LLM roles in the healthcare sector:

Document ingestion & parsing

Information extraction

Summarization & simplification

Building structured knowledge APIs

Search & retrieval (optional)
