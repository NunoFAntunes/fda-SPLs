# SPL Ingestion Component

The ingestion component successfully downloads FDA Structured Product Label (SPL) data from DailyMed's public resources.

## What's Implemented

### Core Components

1. **DailyMedDownloader** (`ingest/downloader.py`)
   - Discovers available SPL bulk files from DailyMed
   - Downloads files with progress tracking and retry logic
   - Handles HTTP/HTTPS URLs (FTP URLs are noted but not supported by requests)
   - Calculates MD5 hashes for integrity verification

2. **VersionTracker** (`ingest/tracker.py`)
   - Tracks downloaded files with version numbers
   - Stores metadata including file size, hash, and download time
   - Detects file changes by comparing hashes
   - Provides download statistics and history

3. **Configuration Models** (`ingest/models.py`)
   - `IngestionConfig`: Configurable settings for downloads
   - `DownloadMetadata`: Tracks download information
   - `SPLBulkFile`: Represents available files

### Scripts

1. **Test Script** (`test_ingestion.py`)
   - Comprehensive testing of all components
   - Tests discovery, metadata fetch, download, and version tracking
   - All 4 tests currently pass

2. **Production Script** (`run_ingestion.py`)
   - Command-line interface for production use
   - Supports dry-run mode, force downloads, and configurable options
   - Includes logging and error handling

## Test Results

```
============================================================
TEST SUMMARY
============================================================
Discovery            [PASSED]
Metadata Fetch       [PASSED]
Single Download      [PASSED]
Version Tracking     [PASSED]

Overall: 4/4 tests passed
```

## Current Data Available

The system discovered **3 SPL bulk files** from DailyMed:

1. `dm_spl_zip_files_meta_data.zip` (7.5MB) - Metadata file
2. Additional bulk files are available via the same mechanism

## Usage Examples

### Run Tests
```bash
python test_ingestion.py
```

### Discover Available Files (Dry Run)
```bash
python run_ingestion.py --dry-run
```

### Download All Files
```bash
python run_ingestion.py --download-dir data/raw --log-file ingestion.log
```

### Force Re-download
```bash
python run_ingestion.py --force
```

## Key Features

- ✅ **Automatic Discovery**: Finds available SPL files from DailyMed
- ✅ **Version Tracking**: Uses MD5 hashes to detect changes
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Shows download progress with progress bars
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Handles network failures with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Metadata Storage**: JSON-based metadata tracking
- ✅ **Configurable**: Customizable timeouts, concurrent downloads, etc.
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Command-line interface with logging

## Next Steps

The ingestion component is complete and ready for the next phase: **parsing & normalization** of the downloaded SPL XML files.
